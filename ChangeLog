	* Added getMultipleByPaths() method to the DigitalAssetRepository. With this method you can use the output of the TCA "group" field with "internal_type" set to "folder." Dig?
	* Added $additionalWhere argument to the getByPath() method in the DigitalAssetRepository. This argument is an SQL query string part that should begin with AND.
